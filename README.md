# Pewlett Hackard Analysis for Retiring Employees

## Overview of the analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to identify all of the current employees that are eligible to retire and those that will retire in the upcoming years to create a mentorship program and ease future transitions of retiring staff. The data will be compiled from several sources and to maintain integrity, will utilize the employee ID as the primary key throughout and will use the most current role of the employee in question to avoid duplicate data

## Results

### Employees eligible for retirement
 * There are currently 72,458 employees eligible for retirement
 * The vast majority are senior staff, with 35.% in senior engineering and 34.4 % in senior staff roles
 * Surprisingly, only 2 managers are eligible for retirement, representing a negligible percentage of total retiring employees

### Employees eligible for the mentorship program
 * There are 1940 employees currently employed that are eligible for the mentorship program
 * The number of employees available to mentor is drastically less than the number of retiring employees

## Summary

### Important questions
* If every employee eligible to retire were to retire this year, the company would need to fill 72,458 roles
* With only 1940 employees available for the currently defined mentorship program, there is the potential for a serious gap in knowledge in the company in the next few years and resources will need to be devoted to maintain current service levels

### Additional Queries
The following additional queries can be employed to gain further insight as Pewlett-Hackard prepares for a wave of retirements
* Using salary information, the difference between salary changes for retiring employees and the current market rate for bringing in new hires can be evaluated. This can show what the budget is for bringing in new folks to replace retiring works or perhaps filling the most senior ranks internally and creating openings in the lower tiers to fit within budget constraints, or paying vital roles a little extra to remain on in mentorship roles to ease the transition, or lastly, paying for technology upgrades to potentially sunset some unneeded roles
* Using employee and department data, the company can view the departments that will be most impacted by the retirement wave and compare against those eligible for mentoring to get a fuller picture of where resources need to be devoted to adjust to the upcoming change
* Do more analysis to understand why so few managers are retiring. With such a small number it may be that there are not enough managers to manage all of the teams properly, or some other underlying issue
* Similar to the report for employees eligible for retirement, the company determine how many employees are not eligible for retirement in each department to understand how the changes will impact each line
